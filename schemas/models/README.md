# JSON schema

This read me covers the JSON schema for the schema model (schema_model.json)

## Our workflow

1. This follows the same workflow as defined in the default "README.md" at ~/README.md

2. To ensure that on-premise clients are covered any changes to this document requires a similar change in the 'Meta API' repository under:

  ```bash
  priv/json_schema_specs/schema_model.json
  ```
